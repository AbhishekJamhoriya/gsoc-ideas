# Kubernetes autoscaling setup

## Prerequisites
Prior knowledge in these areas will be an advantage for this project, but none of them
are strictly necessary:

* Kubernetes
* Docker

## The project
A Jitsi setup consists of many moving parts. We have a Docker setup using Compose [here](https://github.com/jitsi/docker-jitsi-meet).

This project would involve creating a Kubernetes setup so members of our community can easily deploy Jitsi Meet to their cluster. The setup would be tailored for auto-scaling bridges and recorders.
