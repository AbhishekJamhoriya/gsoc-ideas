# Step Counter

## Prerequisites
Prior knowledge in these areas will be an advantage for this project, but none of them
are strictly necessary:

* Android/iOS
* JavaScript
* React

## The project
More and more people choose to join video conferences on their mobile device
while walking. It's a great way to make your day less repetitive and stay
physically active while still getting work done!

Wouldn't it be nice if [Jitsi Meet](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet) could integrate
with the step counter on your device and display to you how many steps you're walked during
your conference? It could also display the step count for all participants on
the `Speaker Stats` page, fostering friendly competition.

## Pro tips for your application
Can you find which APIs you can use to access the step counter on Android and iOS?
