# Make Electron Great Again

## Prerequisites
Prior knowledge in these areas will be an advantage for this project, but none of them
are strictly necessary:

* Electron
* JavaScript
* React

## The project
We currently have a "test" Electron client [here](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet-electron). It could use some improvements:

* Use the welcome page from the deployment (this may require updates to the [External API](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/modules/API/external/external_api.js))
* Replace AtlasKit with react-native-paper (using react-native-web)
