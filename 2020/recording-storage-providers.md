# Multiple Recording Storage Providers

## Prerequisites
Prior knowledge in these areas will be an advantage for this project, but none of them
are strictly necessary:

* Kotlin / Java
* JavaScript
* React
* React Native

## The project
We currently have a single remote storage integration for recordings: Dropbox. It works great but not everyone uses Dropbox so we'd like to extend it to support other storage providers.
Here is a (non extensive) list:

- NextCloud / ownCloud
- Google Drive
- Amazon S3

The idea would be to allow the user to pick one of these services, and have a way to configure which of them are available. An interesting idea would be to think about supporting multiple destinations at once!

## Pro tips for your application
Do you have an idea on how to tackle this on mobile? (we currently use the Dropbox SDK)
