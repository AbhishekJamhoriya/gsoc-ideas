# Multiple Live Streaming Providers

## Prerequisites
Prior knowledge in these areas will be an advantage for this project, but none of them
are strictly necessary:

* Kotlin / Java
* JavaScript
* React
* React Native

## The project
We currently have a single live streaming integration: YouTube. We'd like to extend it to support other live streaming services:
Here is a (non extensive) list:

- Facebook
- Generic RTMP
- Some meta-livestreaming platform maybe?

The idea would be to allow the user to pick one of these services, and have a way to configure which of them are available. An interesting idea would be to think about supporting multiple destinations at once!
