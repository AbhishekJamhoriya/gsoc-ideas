# Reactions

## Prerequisites

Prior knowledge in these areas will be an advantage for this project, but none of them
are strictly necessary:

* JavaScript
* React

## The project

In the context of a meeting there are times where one would like to convey a reaction
in a non verbal way, to avoid disruption. "Hearting" a user as they mention something,
a "thumbs up" etc. Communicating this across peers so they all render the reaction
is what this project attempts to accomplish, with a nicely polished UI.
