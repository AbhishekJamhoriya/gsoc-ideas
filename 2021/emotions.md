# Participant emotions analysis

## Prerequisites

Prior knowledge in these areas will be an advantage for this project, but none of them
are strictly necessary:

* JavaScript
* React

## The project

Jitsi Meet currently stores the time each speaker used the microphone. This can be
extrapolated as meeting metadata, which can be used to measure the success of a given
meeting. Another item that can be added to this is the participants emotion thoughout
the meeting. Were they happy in the meeting? Sad? Bored?

Imagine a teacher being able to adjust their lessons based on how engaged their
students are.
