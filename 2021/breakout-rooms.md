# Breakout rooms

## Prerequisites

Prior knowledge in these areas will be an advantage for this project, but none of them
are strictly necessary:

* JavaScript
* React

## The project

There are scenarios (mainly in education) where meetings start as a single large group
which then is broken out into smaller groups temporarily, and are merged back in the
larger meeting afterwards.

Jitsi Meet currently does not have the ability to coordinate these breakout sessions.
This project aims to implement that functionality.

## Pro tips for your application

Do you have an idea on how to tackle this on mobile?
