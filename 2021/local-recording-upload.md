# Local recordings and upload service

## Prerequisites

Prior knowledge in these areas will be an advantage for this project, but none of them
are strictly necessary:

* JavaScript
* React

## The project

In certain scenarios such as podcasts or radio interviews it is desirable to make
high quality uncompressed audio recordings of each individual participant and upload
them to a server in a lossless format for further processing. Same goes for video.

Jitsi Meet already has a way to record the local audio but it's not uploaded anywhere, thus
making it somewhat hard to consume. In addition no video is recorded locally.
This project would add local video recordings and content uploading capabilities
so those recordings can be gathered in a single place for easy consumption.
